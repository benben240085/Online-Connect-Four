I used python's pygame library to create the gui for the connect four board and I used python's socket and pickle libraries to retrieve and send information from an external server I set up linode. Therefore, users can play each other from around the world. 

Some addtional features I put was that it tells each client whether it's "Your Move" or "Opp. Move" as well as a tracker for each client's wins and the game's ties. Furthermore, when clients win, lose, or tie a message is printed onto the screen to let the user know what happened.
